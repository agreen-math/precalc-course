    <title>Rational Functions Vocabulary</title>

    <introduction>
        <p>
            In this section, we will define rational functions and discuss their characteristics.
            We will also discuss how to determine the domain, intercepts, and asymptotes of a rational function.
            Understanding these concepts is crucial for analyzing and graphing rational functions effectively.
            We will also explore how to identify vertical, horizontal, and oblique asymptotes, which are key features of rational functions.

            <title>Rational Function</title>
<statement>
           A <alert>rational function</alert> is a function of the form
<me>
    R(x)=\dfrac{n(x)}{d(x)}
</me>
where <m>n(x)</m> and <m>d(x)</m> are polynomial functions and <m>d</m> is not the zero polynomial.
</statement>
        
         The <em>domain</em> of a rational function is the set of all real numbers <em>except</em> the &#x3C;m>x&#x3C;/m>-values for which <em> <m>d(x)=0</m> </em>.
