        <title>The Leading Term Test</title>

        <p>
            The <em>leading term test</em> is a way to determine the <em>end behavior</em> of a polynomial function.
            The end behavior of a polynomial function is determined by the <em>degree</em> and the <em>leading coefficient</em>.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <em>Odd</em> degree polynomial functions
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Ends go toward <em>opposite</em> infinities
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            Ends go toward <em>the same</em> infinity

                        <li>
                            the right end goes toward <em>positive</em> infinity

                    </ul>
                </li>

                        <li>
                            the right end goes toward <em>negative</em> infinity
                        </li>
                    </ul>

            Limit notation is a way to describe the end behavior of a function.

        <p>
            The notation
            <me>
                \lim_{x\to\infty}f(x)=L
            </me>
            is read as "the limit of <m>f(x)</m> as <m>x</m> approaches <em>positive infinity</em> is <m>L</m>" and means that, as <m>x</m> approaches <em>positive infinity</em>, the output (<m>f(x)</m> or <m>y</m>) values function approach the value <m>L</m>.
            This describes the <em>right end</em> of the graph.
        </p>

        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    For polynomial functions, the limit as <m>x</m> approaches <em>positive infinity</em> is either <em>positive infinity</em> or <em>negative infinity</em>.
                </li>
            </ul>

        <p>
            The notation
            <me>
                \lim_{x\to-\infty}f(x)=L
            </me>
            is read as "the limit of <m>f(x)</m> as <m>x</m> approaches <em>negative infinity</em> is <m>L</m>" and means that, as <m>x</m> approaches <em>negative infinity</em>, the output (<m>f(x)</m> or <m>y</m>) values function approach the value <m>L</m>.
            This describes the <em>left end</em> of the graph.

        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    For polynomial functions, the limit as <m>x</m> approaches <em>negative infinity</em> is either <em>positive infinity</em> or <em>negative infinity</em>.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <note>
            <p>
                Infinity is not a real number, and a limit is defined as a real number that a function approaches.
                However, it's common to say that the limit is "infinity" or "diverges to infinity" to describe the unbounded behavior of the function.
