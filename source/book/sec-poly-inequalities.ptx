    <title>Solving Polynomial Inequalities</title>

    <p>
        To solve a polynomial inequality, follow these steps:
    </p>
<p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Solve the corresponding polynomial equation to find the critical points.
        </li>

        <li>
            Test points between and beyond each critical point in the original inequality to determine the intervals on which the inequality is true.
        </li>

        <li>
            Write the solution in interval notation.
        </li>
    </ol>
