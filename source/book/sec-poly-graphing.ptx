  <title>Steps for Graphing a Polynomial</title>

  <p>
    The following steps can be used to sketch the graph of a polynomial function <m>f</m> given in factored form.
    The steps are not necessarily in order, and some may be skipped depending on the function.
    The more information you have about the function, the easier it will be to sketch the graph.
    The more points you have, the more accurate the graph will be.
  </p>

  <p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Check for <em>symmetry</em>.
        (optional)
      </li>

      <li>
        Determine the <em>real zeros</em> of the function and their <em>multiplicities</em>.
        Use this information to determine whether the graph <em>crosses</em> or <em>bounces</em> on the <m>x</m>-axis at each <m>x</m>-intercept.
      </li>

      <li>
        Determine the <em>end behavior</em> as <m>x\rightarrow\infty</m> and as <m>x\rightarrow-\infty</m>
      </li>

      <li>
        Find the <em> <m>y</m>-intercept</em> of the graph of the function by evaluating <m>f(0)</m>.
      </li>

      <li>
        Find <em>additional points</em> between intercepts as needed.
      </li>

      <li>
        Draw a <em>smooth curve</em> through the points to sketch the graph.
      </li>
    </ol>
