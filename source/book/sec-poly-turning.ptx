            <p>
            If <m>f</m> is a polynomial function of <em>degree</em> <m>n</m>, then the graph of <m>f</m> has <em>at most</em> <m>n-1</m> <em>turning points</em>.
            (This also works in reverse: <m>n-1</m> <em>turning points</em> means the <em>degree is at least</em> <m>n</m>)
        </p>
