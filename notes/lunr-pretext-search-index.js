Determine end behavior of polynomial functions.    Write the equation of a polynomial function given the characteristics or a graph of the polynomial function.    Solve polynomial equations and inequalities.    Sketch the graph of a polynomial function.    Solve applications involving polynomial functions or inequalities.       Polynomial Functions   Polynomial Function   A polynomial function is a function of the form where    is a real number called the leading coefficient      is a whole number called the degree            The domain of a polynomial function is the set of all real numbers .    The graph of a polynomial function is both smooth (no sharp corners or cusps ) and continuous (no gaps or holes ).      The Leading Coefficient Test (End Behavior)     Odd degree polynomial functions   Ends go toward opposite infinities        Even degree polynomial functions   Ends go toward the same infinity        Positive leading coefficient   the right end goes toward positive infinity        Negative leading coefficient   the right end goes toward negative infinity               Turning Points  If is a polynomial function of degree  , then the graph of has at most   turning points . (This also works in reverse:  turning points means the degree is at least  )    Real Zeros and Multiplicity  If is a factor of a polynomial function (where is the highest exponent possible), then is called a real zero of multiplicity of  .    If has odd multiplicity, the graph will cross the -axis at .   The sign of  changes from one side to the other.       If has even multiplicity, the graph will bounce the -axis at .   The sign of  does not change from one side to the other.        NOTE: Vocabulary The following statements are equivalent for polynomial functions:     is a real number for which        is a real zero of the polynomial function      is a root of the polynomial function      is an  -intercept of the graph of      is a factor of the graph of      is a real solution of the equation         SUMMARY: Steps for Graphing a Polynomial Function    Check for symmetry . (optional)    Determine the real zeros of the function and their multiplicities . Use this information to determine whether the graph crosses or bounces on the -axis at each -intercept.    Determine the end behavior as and as     Find the  -intercept of the graph of the function by evaluating .    Find additional points between intercepts as needed.    Draw a smooth curve through the points to sketch the graph.
